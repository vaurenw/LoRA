    "question": "Understanding NoC Interconnect\nThe NoC interconnect breaks the problem of communication between entities into smaller problems, such as how to transport transactions between nodes in the system, and how to encapsulate transactions into packets for transport. The NoC interconnect is different from traditional interconnects in one simple, but powerful way. Instead of treating the interconnect as a monolithic component of the system, the NoC approach treats the interconnect as a protocol stack, where different layers implement different functions of the interconnect. The power of traditional\nprotocol stacks, such as TCP-over-IP-over-Ethernet, is that the information at each layer is encapsulated by the layer below it. The power of the Platform Designer NoC implementation comes from the same source, the encapsulation of information at each layer of the protocol stack.\nWhat is the primary purpose of a NoC interconnect?",
